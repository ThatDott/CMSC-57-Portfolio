            <h2>Graph Connectivity</h2>
            <p>Graph connectivity examines how vertices (nodes) in a graph are connected. A graph is connected if there is a path between every pair of vertices. Key concepts include strong connectivity (every vertex is reachable from every other vertex) and weak connectivity (some vertices may be unreachable).</p>

        <section id="default">
            <h2>Connected and Disconnected Graphs</h2>
            <p>Connected Graph = An undirected graph is connected if there is a path between any pair of vertices. In other words, every vertex can be reached from any other vertex.
                <br><br>
                Disconnected Graph = An undirected graph is disconnected if there exist at least two vertices such that there is no path between them. The graph is divided into two or more disjoint subgraphs.

            <h2>Strongly and Weakly Connected Graphs</h2>
            <p>Strongly Connected Graph = A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a directed path from any vertex to every other vertex and vice versa.
                <br><br>
                Weakly Connected Graph = A directed graph is weakly connected if replacing all of its directed edges with undirected edges produces a connected (undirected) graph.

            <p>
                Exploring graph connectivity helps understand relationships within networks, considering how connection arrangements influence the flow of information or resources.                
                <br><br>
                Applications:
                Graph connectivity ensures reliable communication in networks, like the internet and social media. It optimizes routes in transportation and logistics, making systems efficient and resilient. In urban planning, it helps integrate and manage city infrastructure for better resource use and emergency response.        </section>
