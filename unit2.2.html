            <h2>Probability Theory</h2>
            <p>Probability theory is essential for understanding and quantifying chance and uncertainty. It starts with basic concepts such as sample space and events. The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes in a situation, like heads or tails in a coin flip. Events are specific outcomes within this space, such as getting heads.</p>

            <h2>Basic Rules of Probability Theory</h2>
            <p>Probability is always a positive number<br>
                P(E) >= 0
                <br><br>
                The probability of the sample space is equal to 1<br>
                P(S) = 1
                <br><br>
                For any two mutually exclusive events, the probability of either event occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities.<br>
                P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B)
                <br><br>
                The probability of both events A and B occurring is the product of their individual probabilities<br>
                P(A <big>∩</big> B) = P(A) x P(B)
            </p>

            <h2>Conditional Probability</h2>
            <p>The probability of an event 
                A occurring given that event
                B has occurred is denoted as 
                P(A|B) and is calculated as:
                <br><br>
                P(A|B) = [P(A) <big>∩</big> P(B)] / P(B)
                <br>
                Such that P(B) > 0
                <br><br><br>
                Example: Given a deck of 52 cards, what is the probability that a card drawn is a King, given that it is a face card?
                <br><br>
                Since a King is a face card
                <br>
                P(A <big>∩</big> B) = P(A) = 4/52 = 1/13
                <br>
                P(B) = 12/52 = 3/13
                <br><br>
                P(A|B) = [P(A) <big>∩</big> P(B)] / P(B)
                <br>
                P(A|B) = 1/13 / 3/13 
                <br>
                P(A|B) = 1/3
                <br>

            <p>
                Understanding probability theory changes how we think about uncertainty. It makes us question our assumptions and encourages us to think more carefully when making decisions. By considering the likelihood of different outcomes, we can make more thoughtful and informed choices.
                <br><br>
                Applications:
                Probability theory is widely used in risk management, medical diagnosis, and weather forecasting, helping make informed decisions based on probabilistic analysis.        </section>
