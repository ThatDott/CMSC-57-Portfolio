            <h2>What is Combinatronics?</h2>
            <p>Combinatorics focuses on counting and arranging objects, a key area in discrete mathematics. It involves studying how items can be arranged and counted using four main rules: the Product Rule, the Sum Rule, the Subtraction Rule (inclusion-exclusion), and Tree Diagrams.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="default">
            <h2>Product Rule</h2>
            <p>Suppose a procedure can be broken
                down into a sequence of two tasks. There are n<sub>1</sub> ways to
                do the first task and n<sub>2</sub> ways to do the second task. Then
                there are n<sub>1</sub> times n<sub>2</sub> ways to do the procedure.
                <br><br>
                Example: If you have 3 different shirts and 2 different pants, the product rule tells you that there are 
                3 × 2 = 6 distinct outfits you can wear by choosing one shirt and one pair of pants.
            </p>

        </section>
        <section id="default">
            <h2>Sum Rule</h2>
            <p>The sum rule states that if there are 
                n<sub>1</sub> ways to do task A and 
                n<sub>2</sub> ways to do task B, where the tasks are mutually exclusive (cannot happen at the same time), then there are 
                n<sub>1</sub> + n<sub>2</sub> ways to do either task A or task B.
                <br><br>
                If you have 5 blue marbles and 3 red marbles, the sum rule tells you that there are 5 + 3 = 8 marbles in total.
            </p>

        </section>
        <section id="default">
            <h2>Subtraction Rule</h2>
            <p>The subtraction rule is used to find the number of outcomes when some of them are not desired. If there are
                n<sub>1</sub> total outcomes and n<sub>2</sub> of them are undesirable, then there are n<sub>1</sub>−n<sub>2</sub> desirable outcomes.
                <br><br>
                Example: If you have 10 candies and 3 of them are sour, then the subtraction rule tells you there are
                10 − 3 = 7 candies that are not sour.
            </p>

        <section id="default">
            <h2>Tree Diagram</h2>
            <p>The tree diagram is a visual representation used to organize and list all possible outcomes of a series of events. Each branch represents a different choice or outcome. Tree diagrams are particularly useful when dealing with multiple stages of events or decisions.
                <br><br>
                Example: Suppose you want to choose a shirt from 2 blue shirts and 3 red shirts, and then from those, you can choose a sleeve-less or with sleeves shirt.

            <p>
                Combinatorics shows us that large problems can be broken down into smaller, manageable parts, enhancing our comprehension. We should learn combinatorics as it is an important skill set that allow us to solve complex problems in a simpler way. We can also provide ourselves an advantage in estimating the possible outcomes of different scenarios.  
                <br><br>
                Applications:
                The principles of combinatorics are valuable in everyday decision-making, such as planning events, organizing tasks, or making choices, by helping us understand and manage various possibilities.
